## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m a front-end developer currently diving into the world of web animations and interactive experiences using GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform). This repository is a collection of my experiments, projects, and learning exercises as I explore how to make websites feel more dynamic, engaging, and alive.

GSAP offers a powerful, flexible animation toolkit that gives precise control over timing, motion, and user interaction. I'm using it to learn how to create smooth transitions, interactive UI elements, scroll-based animations, and more immersive visual effects that go beyond static layouts. With each project, I aim to better understand the nuances of animation timing, easing functions, and the creative potential of motion in web design.

As someone with a background in front-end development, Iâ€™m focused on integrating GSAP into responsive, accessible interfaces built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Iâ€™m experimenting with concepts like timeline-based sequencing, SVG animation, hover effects, and scroll-triggered behaviorsâ€”while also keeping performance and usability in mind.

This repository includes everything from small animation tests to larger interactive page concepts. Some are purely creative explorations, while others are focused on applying animation principles to real-world UI components like menus, sliders, and modals.

If youâ€™re also learning GSAP or passionate about web animation, feel free to explore the code, open issues, or share ideas. Iâ€™m always looking to improve and would love to collaborate or get feedback from others who are excited about interactive front-end development.

Thanks for visitingâ€”and hereâ€™s to building the web that moves, one animation at a time.
